NAV migration from Mercurial to Git
===================================

NAV migrated from Mercurial to Git as its VCS system on 17 January 2017.

The file ``hg2gitmapping.txt`` contains a mapping of Mercurial revision
numbers to the corresponding Git revision numbers, in case they are needed for
posterity.
