NAV migrated from Subversion to Mercurial as its SCM system on 1 April
2008.  

This directory contains the file localtags, which maps Mercurial
changeset IDs to SVN revision numbers using Mercurial tags.  If you
ever have the need to look up an old reference to an SVN revision, you
can install the localtags file in the .hg/ directory of your
repository.

Usage example
-------------
You want to know whatever happened to SVN revision 4242:

  $ hg log -r svn.4242
  changeset:   3726:00d0929f54bd
  tag:         svn.4242
  user:        Stein Magnus Jodal <stein.magnus.jodal@uninett.no>
  date:        Wed Oct 03 12:22:04 2007 +0000
  summary:     Fix bug in FrontpageTemplate which fails with Cheetah<1.0. Put this one in 3.3.1.


Caveats
-------

The original SVN repository was split into several Mercurial
repositories, one for each development branch.  Many of the
changesets from the localtags file will therefore not exist in the
particular repository you are working with.  Many hg commands,
including log, will complain profusely about the missing nodes as it
parses the localtags file.  These complaints can be safely ignored,
although they will annoyingly clutter your output somewhat.
